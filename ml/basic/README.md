> according to the png,I will do some analyse.
1. we should not overfit the model and also get a good generalization
2. absolutely, the degree of 4,5,6 are not the good one for a huge loss and their tendency
3. other degrees can not be judged by CV for the model is not ensure, I need other algorithms to find the best model
